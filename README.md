# Webbify

A web application created to search artists, songs and albums to get useful information!

# About Webbify

This is a project completed during winter 2021 in the course DH2642 Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web by
4 students at KTH. The aim of this project was to create a web application containing information about your favourite artists, songs and album to get to know them better.

This application can be used to search your favourite songs and artists through the use of SpotifyAPI.
With the use of SpotifyAPI you can access millions of artists and songs from around the world. By adding whichever song or track to your user, you can access them whenever you want since our app allows you to store them and delete them at will.

## Features (More to be implemented)
